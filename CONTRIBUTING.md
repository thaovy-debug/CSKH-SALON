# Contributing to Owly

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Owly! This guide will help you get started.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Hesper-Labs/owly.git
cd owly

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL connection string

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

## Code Style

- **TypeScript** for all code
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with the Owly custom color system (`owly-primary`, `owly-surface`, etc.)
- **Conventional commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`
- **Zod validation** on all API request bodies (`src/lib/validations.ts`)
- **Structured logging** via `logger` from `src/lib/logger.ts` (never use `console.log`/`console.error`)
- **Pagination** on all list endpoints using `parsePagination` and `paginatedResponse` from `src/lib/pagination.ts`
- **Error responses** using `AppError` and `Errors` factory from `src/lib/errors.ts`
- No emojis in code, commits, or UI text
- All UI text in English

## Writing Tests

All new features must include tests. We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with mocked Prisma and external services.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/unit/customer-resolver.test.ts
```

Test files go in `tests/` matching the source structure:
- `tests/unit/` for library functions
- `tests/api/` for API route handlers
- `tests/security/` for security-focused tests

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`

3. Run `npm run test` and ensure all tests pass
4. Run `npm run lint` and fix any errors
5. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` for type checking
6. Write a clear PR description explaining what and why
