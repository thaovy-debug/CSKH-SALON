## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please send an email to the maintainers or use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Hesper-Labs/owly/security/advisories/new).

### What to include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce

- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix and disclosure:** Coordinated with reporter

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

- Set a strong `JWT_SECRET` (use `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- Set a strong `WEBHOOK_SECRET` for webhook payload verification
- Use HTTPS in production (reverse proxy with Nginx/Caddy, or Ingress with TLS in Kubernetes)
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Regularly update dependencies (`npm audit`)
- Restrict database access to localhost or trusted IPs
- Use strong passwords for the admin account
- Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your frontend domain (do not use `*` in production)
- Monitor the `/api/health` endpoint for service degradation
- Review the activity log (`/api/activity`) for suspicious access patterns
